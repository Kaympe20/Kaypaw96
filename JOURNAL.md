I setup the layout using [keyboard-layout-editor](https://keyboard-layout-editor.com/)

I created the basic layout of the keyswitches in the schematic after learning how matrixes work

... only to realize I need diodes.

I wired up the matrix with labels

The pico didn't have enough pins so I've begun work directly using the RP2040 using the [RP2040 hardware design datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/hardware-design-with-rp2040.pdf).

I finished up the setup for the RP2040 including power delivery, USB communications, and

I research JLC PCBA Extended and added all of the neopixels on a single pin that will draw 1.3A.

I got a dark theme to stop searing my eyes and got capacitors for the NeoPixels, as well as having to figure out that 0.1uF is the same as 100nF.

I found 0805 capacitors of varying capcity on [LCSC](https://lcsc.com/), imported them using [`easyeda2kicad`](https://github.com/uPesy/easyeda2kicad.py). I then assigned each type to its respective item, before realizing that the ESR of 0805 capacitors is too much for the RP2040 and that I would need 0402 alternatives. After going back to get the diodes, I couldn't find footprints so I had to slightly modify the template 0402 footprint.

I started designing the PCB and started the grueling wiring of each individual key and light. I want to cry üò¢. My fingers and my soul are in pain.

I finished adding all of the neopixels, all 105 of them üò¢.

I added more capacitors as per the spec of the SK6812-MINI's... 52 of them. I love KiCAD üëç.

I started wiring everything to do with the microcontrollers and all of its additional parts. It got hectic and chaotic very quickly.

[@marios](https://github.com/GalaxyGamingBoy) recomended I do a ground pour so I used [my hackpad v2 docs backup](https://hackpad-v2-backup.pages.dev/advancedguide#ground%20pour) to learn how to do one and it started looking much better.

I then started on the rows and collumns, but was again having difficulty in figuring out how to route them without vias because they ruin signal integrity. Then I realized that the keys are binary and signal integrity/noise shouldn't be nearly enough to get to on from off. With that newfound knowledge, I routed all of them using at least 2 vias each.

Here's what the microcontroller section looks like:
